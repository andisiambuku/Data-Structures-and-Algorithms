## Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

Here we shall solve [Minimum in a Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/) challenge

Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

-   `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
-   `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return _the minimum element of this array_ .

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n) time.`

**Example 1:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
</pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
</pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [11,13,15,17]
<strong>Output:</strong> 11
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. </pre>
